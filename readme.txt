All programs are in the "programs" directory.

In order to run a program use the following command:

python simulator.py -f path/to/program -a -e NUMBEROFEXECUTEUNITS

Where NUMBEROFEXECUTEUNITS is the number of execute units you wish to use.
I recommend capping this number at 16, although it can be set higher.

To enter interactive debug mode, use the option -id

In order for a full list of options, use the command
python simulator.py -h
